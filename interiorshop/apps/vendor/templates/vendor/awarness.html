    <br>
    <br>
    By recycling, we contribute to more sustainable development by eliminating or reducing waste and by saving primary resources. Also, recycling some materials, like metals, saves energy (and reduces carbon emissions) since it requires less energy to re-melt scrap than it does to produce new metal from primary resources, i.e. iron ore.

The benefits of recycling are well understood and include:
Reducing waste, i.e. diverting waste from landfill
Saving primary resources, i.e. substituting primary production
Saving energy and associated greenhouse gas emissions through less energy intensive reprocessing.
